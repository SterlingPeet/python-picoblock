A generic lightweight component-based software framework for long running Python programs.

üöÄ Installation
===============

Most typically, the project is included as an external project dependency.
If you want to install the framework, it can be done like this::

    pip install picoblock

You can also install the in-development version with::

    pip install https://github.com/SterlingPeet/python-picoblock/archive/main.zip

https://python-picoblock.readthedocs.io/

üìù Documentation
================

During initial development, documentation is sparse.
It should be set up on readthedocs when the project is mature.

ü§ù Contributing and Development
===============================

If you are working on developing the software, head on over to the
`Developer Notes`_ page for orientation and quick reference.
You can also take a look at the `Contributing Guide`_.

üåé Similar Projects
===================

This project was not created in a vacuum.
It is loosely based on the `F Prime`_ project, which is also a component based software development framework.
